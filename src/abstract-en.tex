Source code authorship identification is the task of deciding who is the author of a program given its source code. This is usually based on the analysis of previously collected samples from a set of candidate authors. There are several use cases for such a method, including attribution and detection of malicious codes, copyright infringement incident resolution, plagiarism detection, etc. As with texts in natural language, there are many distinguishing features in a piece code, like variable names, indentation style, etc. Some of these features are part of the coding style of a programmer. In this work, we investigate authorship attribution of C++ source codes based on the coding style of the authors. We also propose an end-to-end deep learning method for deciding if two source codes are from the same author, even if the involved authors are unknown to the system.
